# 🚀 Sprint 4 – TypeScript & APIs

This repository contains the completed project for Sprint 4 of the IT Academy Frontend course, focused on **TypeScript** and working with **REST APIs**.


## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this sprint is to build a web application that fetches jokes from two different APIs and displays weather information for Barcelona.  
Unlike earlier sprints, we no longer use hardcoded data; instead, we fetch real data using REST API calls and handle it in TypeScript.

Users can rate each joke from **1 to 3**, adding an interactive touch to the application.


## 🚀 Main Goals

✅ Learn the basics of **TypeScript** and compile it to JavaScript  
✅ Practice making HTTP requests to REST APIs  
✅ Combine data from multiple APIs in a single project  
✅ Build a small but functional web app that shows jokes and weather info  
✅ Explore working with Tailwind for styling & responsive design
